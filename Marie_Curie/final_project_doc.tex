		\textbf{Raspberry Pi 2 Model B}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Justification (Why use a raspberry pi 2 for this?)
				\begin{itemize}
					\item \textit{Mobility} \\
						We want it to be small so that it can fit inside the robot. Having to use a full size laptop with a robot limits its mobility significantly and we'd like to avoid that.
					\item \textit{More computing power than the previous version of raspberry pi} \\
						A color image consists of three two-dimensional matrices for red, green, and blue. To process this information OpenCV makes heavy use of matrix operations.
						It is important that whatever we do with OpenCV that the raspberry pi 2 can handle it.
					\item \textit{GPIO for interfacing} \\
						Our high level system design shows that the raspberry pi 2 must interface with an arduino. The arduino is then responsible for making the robot move.
						The 40-pin GPIO header on the raspberry pi 2 can be used for that very purpose. Furthermore, its even possible that the arduino can be taken out of the picture altogether.
					\item \textit{Easy to use} \\
						Raspberry pi's are very easy to set up. They come with an already optimized operating system that is capable of using all the software needed to achieve what is outlined in this report.
					\item \textit{Can be set up for remote access with USB wireless module} \\
						Raspberry pi's operating system already has a kernel driver for USB devices which means an off the shelf USB wireless module can be purchased and used for internet access.
						It is likely that additional software might need to be installed but it is also likely that the raspberry pi can handle it.
